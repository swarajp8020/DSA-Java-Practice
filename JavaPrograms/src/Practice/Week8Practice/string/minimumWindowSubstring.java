package Practice.Week8Practice.string;
/// Explaination:
///❓ count = t.length()
/// ELI5:
/// “I still need all characters from t.”
/// Each time I see a required character:
/// count--
/// When count == 0:
/// 👉 I have everything.
/// ❓ if (freq[c] > 0) count--;
/// ELI5:
/// “This character was actually needed.”
/// If freq[c] <= 0, it means:
/// either extra character
/// or already satisfied
/// So we don’t reduce count.
/// ❓ Why do we do freq[c]-- even if not needed?
/// Because:
/// It tracks extra characters
/// Helps when shrinking
/// Negative values = surplus
/// ❓ Why this shrinking logic works
/// freq[lc]++;
/// if (freq[lc] > 0) count++;
/// ELI5:
/// “I just removed something important.
/// Now the window is invalid again.”
/// So we stop shrinking.
/// WHY THIS VERSION IS SMARTER THAN MAP-BASED ONE
/// No hashmap overhead
/// Constant space
/// Cleaner logic
/// Interviewers love this variant
/// You just need to remember what freq means.
/// QUICK DEPTH CHECK (DON’T SKIP)
/// Answer these out loud:
/// Why do we build freq from t and not s?
/// What does a negative value in freq mean?
/// Why do we decrement freq even when char isn’t needed?
/// If you can answer these calmly → LC-76 is locked.
