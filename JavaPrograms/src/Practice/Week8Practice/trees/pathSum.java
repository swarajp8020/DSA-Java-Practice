/// Explaination - PATH SUM — BIG PICTURE FIRST
/// What kind of paths are we talking about?
/// Path must go top → down
/// It does not have to end at a leaf (Path Sum I does end at leaf)
/// You cannot go up or sideways
/// So this is pure DFS with state carried along the path.
/// PATH SUM I (ELI5)
/// Problem
/// Is there any root-to-leaf path where the sum of node values equals targetSum?
/// You don’t need the path.
/// You just need true / false.
/// THE ONLY QUESTION YOU SHOULD ASK
/// “What state do I need to carry while going down the tree?”
/// Answer:
/// The remaining sum.
/// MENTAL MODEL (LOCK THIS)
/// At each node:
/// Subtract node value from targetSum
/// Pass the remaining sum to children
/// At a leaf:
/// if remaining sum == 0 → success
/// INTERVIEW EXPLANATION (PRACTICE THIS)
/// For Path Sum I:
/// “I pass the remaining sum downward.
/// At each leaf, I check if the remaining sum equals the node value.”
