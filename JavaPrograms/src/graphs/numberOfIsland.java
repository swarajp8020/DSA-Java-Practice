// LC 200 Number of Islands - https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=rr2ss0g5
/// Grid of '1' (land) and '0' (water)
/// An island = group of connected lands (up/down/left/right)
/// Goal:
/// Count how many separate islands exist.
/// Pattern
/// Loop all cells:
/// if cell is '1' and not visited → found a new island
/// do DFS/BFS to mark the whole island visited
/// Each DFS/BFS call = 1 island.
/// Why this works (short + durable)
/// Every time you find unvisited land → it’s a new island
/// DFS floods the entire island and turns it into water ('0')
/// So that island never gets counted again
/// 🚨 Common mistakes (catch early)
/// ❌ Forgetting boundaries
/// ❌ Not marking visited (infinite recursion)
/// ❌ Diagonal connection assumed (NO diagonal here)
//Interview line - “Whenever I find land, I count one island and DFS flood-fill it to water so it won’t be counted again.”
