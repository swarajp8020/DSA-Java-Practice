import java.util.HashSet;

/// ELI5
/// You have numbers.
/// You want the longest chain like:
/// 1,2,3,4 (consecutive)
/// You’re NOT allowed to sort (sorting = O(n log n)).
/// We want O(n).
/// Core trick
/// Put all numbers into a HashSet.
/// Then for each number:
/// Only start counting if it is the start of a sequence
/// Meaning: (num - 1) is NOT in the set
/// Then count forward:
/// num, num+1, num+2...
