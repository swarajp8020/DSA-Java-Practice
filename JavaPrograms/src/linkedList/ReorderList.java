// LC 143 - Reorder List https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=rr2ss0g5
///What the problem asks (plain words)
/// Given a linked list:
/// 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
/// Reorder it like this:
/// 1 → 5 → 2 → 4 → 3
/// Rules:
/// You cannot create new nodes
/// You must rearrange pointers
/// Modify the list in place
/// The key realization (VERY IMPORTANT)
/// This problem is exactly 3 problems glued together:
/// Find the middle of the list
/// Reverse the second half
/// Merge the two halves alternately
/// You have already solved all three separately.
/// That’s why we waited before doing this.
/// Step-by-step mental model (ELI5)
/// Let’s take:
/// 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
/// ✅ Step 1: Find the middle (LC 876)
/// Using slow & fast pointers:
/// slow ends at 3
/// So we split:
/// First half:  1 → 2 → 3
/// Second half: 4 → 5
/// ✅ Step 2: Reverse the second half (LC 206)
/// Reverse:
/// 4 → 5
/// Becomes:
/// 5 → 4
/// Now we have:
/// l1 = 1 → 2 → 3
/// l2 = 5 → 4
/// ✅ Step 3: Merge alternately (LC 21-style merge)
/// We interleave:
/// 1 → 5 → 2 → 4 → 3
/// Done.
/// Why this works (intuition)
/// First half gives order from the start
/// Reversed second half gives order from the end
/// Alternating merge stitches them together
/// No extra memory. Just pointer rewiring.
/// One thing people miss (IMPORTANT)
/// Before reversing, you MUST cut the list:
/// slow.next = null;
/// Otherwise, you’ll create a cycle.
/// Time & Space (say confidently)
/// Time: O(n)
/// Space: O(1)
/// Interview explanation (THIS IS GOLD)
/// Say this calmly:
/// “I split the list into two halves using slow and fast pointers, reverse the second half, then merge the two lists alternately. All operations are done in place.”
