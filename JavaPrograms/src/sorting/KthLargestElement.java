/// ELI5 Explanation
/// Imagine you have a bag of exam marks:
/// [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4]
/// And I ask:
/// “Tell me the 2nd highest mark.”
/// You could sort everything and pick the 2nd from last.
/// But sorting the whole list is expensive.
/// Instead, think like this:
/// Keep a small box that only stores the top k biggest numbers.
/// Whenever a new number comes:
/// If it’s bigger than the smallest in the box, replace it.
/// At the end, the smallest number inside that box is the answer.
/// That box is called a min-heap of size k.
/// Pattern Identification
/// This is a classic:
/// 👉 Top K pattern using Min Heap
/// Whenever you see:
/// • kth largest
/// • kth smallest
/// • top k elements
/// Think:
/// ✔ Heap, not sorting
/// Logic
/// Create a min heap
/// Insert elements one by one
/// If heap size > k → remove smallest
/// At the end, heap top = kth largest
