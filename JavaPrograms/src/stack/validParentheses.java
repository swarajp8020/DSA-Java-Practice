/// Imagine you’re opening and closing doors.
/// ( means you opened a door
/// ) means you must close the last door you opened
/// Rules of real life:
/// You can’t close a door that was never opened
/// You must close doors in reverse order
/// At the end, no door should be left open
/// A stack is perfect for this because:
/// It remembers the last opened thing
/// It forces you to close things in reverse order
/// That’s it.
/// That’s the entire problem.
/// Why stack is required (very important)
/// Why not a counter?
/// Because this is not just about count, it’s about order.
/// Example:
/// (]
/// Count says: 1 opening, 1 closing → looks fine
/// Reality says: wrong type → invalid
/// Stack remembers which opening came last.
/// Counters can’t.
/// 3️⃣ Step-by-step logic (human thinking)
/// We scan the string left to right.
/// Rule 1: If we see an opening bracket
/// Push it into stack
/// Means: “I’ll close this later”
/// Rule 2: If we see a closing bracket
/// Stack must NOT be empty
/// (otherwise: closing without opening ❌)
/// The top of stack must match this closing
/// (otherwise: wrong order/type ❌)
/// Pop the top
/// Rule 3: After full scan
/// Stack must be empty
/// (otherwise: some openings never closed ❌)
/// If all rules pass → ✅ valid
/// 4️⃣ Dry run (must do mentally)
/// Input:
/// "{[()]}"
/// Char	Stack
/// {	    {
/// [    { [
/// (    { [ (
/// )    { [
/// ]    {
/// }	empty
/// End → stack empty → ✅ valid
/// 5️⃣ Common mistakes (catch them early)
/// ❌ Popping without checking stack empty
/// ❌ Comparing wrong bracket types
/// ❌ Forgetting final stack empty check
/// Mental rule:
/// Every push must have exactly one matching pop
/// One “WHY” question (mandatory)
/// Why do we check stack.isEmpty() at the end?
/// Because:
/// Remaining items mean openings that never got closed
/// Example: "((("
/// All characters processed, but structure incomplete
/// 8️⃣ What today achieved
/// You learned what stack really does
/// You understood order vs count
/// You built the base for:
/// Monotonic stack
/// Expression evaluation
/// Next greater element problems
/// This is the root of Phase 3.
