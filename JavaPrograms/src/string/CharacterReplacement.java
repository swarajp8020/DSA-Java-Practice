///❓ Important Question You’ll Be Asked
/// “Why don’t we reduce maxFreq when shrinking the window?”
/// Answer:
/// Because even if maxFreq is slightly outdated, it does not affect correctness.
/// It may allow a window that is slightly larger, but it never misses the optimal answer.
/// This is expected and accepted.
