/// ELI5 FIRST - In LC 647, you asked:
/// “How many palindromes can I form from each center?”
/// In LC 5, you ask:
/// “What is the biggest palindrome I can form from each center?”
/// Same expansion. Different goal.
/// CORE IDEA (DO NOT OVERTHINK)
/// Every palindrome expands from a center.
/// For each index i, check:
/// (i, i) → odd-length palindromes
/// (i, i + 1) → even-length palindromes
/// While expanding:
/// If current length > best length → update answer
/// WHAT WE TRACK
/// Two things only:
/// start → starting index of longest palindrome
/// maxLen → length of longest palindrome
/// That’s it.
/// Why this works
/// For odd palindromes → center is exact
/// For even palindromes → center is between characters
/// This formula correctly shifts start in both cases
/// You don’t need to derive it in interviews.
/// You just need to understand that it maps length → start index.
/// INTERVIEW ONE-LINER (MEMORIZE THIS)
/// “I expand around each possible center and track the longest palindrome found so far.”
/// COMMON INTERVIEW FOLLOW-UPS
/// Q: Can this be optimized further -> Yes, Manacher’s Algorithm in O(n), but this solution is expected.
/// Q: Why not DP -> DP is harder to explain and uses extra space.
